1. What is C Sharp ?

    C# is a general-purpose, high-level programming language.

2. Why is C Sharp preferred over other language or advantages of C Sharp?
    
    - Fast develeopment time 
    - high Scalability
    - Object - oriented 
    - community

3. What is a namespace?
    A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifier and class 

4. Typecasting ?
    - Implicit Casting - smaller type to larget type (easy)
            char -> int -> long -> float -> double
    - Explicit Casting - larget type to smaller type (hard and force)
            double -> float -> long -> int -> char

5. What is OOPs ?
    programming based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.

6. What are the advantages of using oops concept?

    - clean code 
    - reusablity 
    - fast and easy to write and debug
    - short develeopment time

7. What is a class ?
    Class is the template or blueprint of the object.

8. What is a object ?
    Object is the instance of a class. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity

9. What is a method ?
    They are functions defined inside the class

10 . Identifiers ?
    - public - access to all
    - private - only accessible within the same class
    - protected - only accessible with in the class and its sub-classes

11. What is encapsulation?
    - It is used to make senstitive data hidden from users

    concepts in it -
    - get
    - set

    example - 
        class Person
        {
            private string name; // field

            public string Name   // property
            {
                get { return name; }   // get method
                set { name = value; }  // set method
            }
        }
    
    use:-
        - security
        - restriction of data
    
12. abstract class ?
    - we cannot create a object directly using a abstract class . we need to inherit it from other class to access it

13. What is Interfaces ?
    - Like a class but we cant call any methods in it 
    - Methods in interfaces are just named but does not perform any 


14. What is enum ?
    - collection of constants is called enums

15. what is value type and refernce type ?
    value type - the variable holds the value 
    reference type - the variable holds the location of the data

16. Difference between GetType and typeof ?
    GetType is evaluated at runtime and typeof at compile time

17. What is a Struct ?
    It is like a class but 
        - It is a value type
        - cant perform inheritance 

    Ex - 
        struct Coordinate
        {
            public int x;
            public int y;
        }








































Syntax 

For Reading :-
    Cosole.ReadLine() - returns a string ( convert the values like in python)

For Writing :-
    Cosole.WriteLine() - Content with new line
    Console.Write() - Content with same line

Comment -

    multi line - /* */
    single line - //

TO ADD few things in string -

    \n - new line
    \t - tab space
    \b - backspace

foreach loop :- 
    string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
    foreach (string i in cars) 
    {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    }

Create a array :
string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
